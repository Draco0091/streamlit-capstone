"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose",Excellent built high performing dehumidifier,5.0,"Click to play video
Spring, fall and late fall RV trailer camping always generates a lot of condensation inside the trailer. I was looking for a decent dehumidifier. After searching on Amazon, I settled on this based on pricing and features.

What you may like
1. First thing that is evident is how heavy and well-built this unit is. It gives a lot of confidence on the build quality and components.
2. Aesthetically pleasing looking, so it won't look out of place either at home or elsewhere.
3. Easy to use, simple one press buttons to operate various functions like timer, modes etc. There are several options as listed in the description.
4. Works very well. I used it in the bathroom to see how it works, and it dropped the humidity from 50% to 38% in about an hour a half to 45 min.

What you may not like:
1. It is heavy, and not a small unit, so if you don't need it for a large space, then this may not be the one.

If you are looking to get a dehumidifier that built solidly and performs exceptionally well and have a large space, this would be very good choice."
"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose","Excellent Dehumidifier – Quiet, Efficient, and Easy to Use!",5.0,"Pros:

Powerful Moisture Removal: It handles humidity in my 500 sq ft basement easily. The air feels fresher, and the musty smell is gone.

Multiple Modes: I love the Auto Mode for everyday use, and the Dry Clothes Mode really came in handy during rainy days. Sleep Mode is super quiet—I hardly notice it running.

Whisper Quiet: At just 35dB, it’s almost silent. Perfect for the bedroom or office where noise can be distracting.

Large Water Tank: The 75oz tank lasts longer than I expected, and the auto shut-off with overflow protection gives peace of mind. I also connected the included hose for continuous drainage—very convenient!

User-Friendly: The touch controls are intuitive, and the built-in handle and wheels make it easy to move from room to room. Plus, it looks sleek and modern—not bulky or industrial.

Minor Con:
The tank fills up pretty quickly if you're in a high humidity area, but that just means it's working efficiently. With the drain hose connected, it's a non-issue.

Overall, this dehumidifier is a fantastic value for the price. It’s reliable, efficient, and packed with thoughtful features. Highly recommended for anyone needing a compact but powerful solution for home humidity!"
"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose",Small but mighty,5.0,"This little dehumidifier has performed perfect drying out a damp basement and has the humidity regulated in just 24hrs after running. It brought the humidity down from
60% to 45% in that time and this after a very wet spring season.

I have hooked it up for continuous draining using the included hose and another hose I purchased. The reservoir bucket is quite small and for a large area like we are using it in, would need emptying many times per day.

It is easy to set up and the instructions are included on a sticker directly on the unit which is a brilliant idea because nobody wants to keep instruction manuals for appliances.

Given size it’s also very lightweight and could easily be handled by someone without a lot of strength. Unlike the big units that can weigh 50 to 75 pounds this one is probably only 20/25 pounds.

Very happy with the performance of this unit and happy to give it a five star review."

"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose",Does the job exceptionally well! 👌,5.0,Ran it overnight when our basement had a leak and was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well.

"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose",Quiet & Impactful,5.0,"As i moved to basement apartment i feel like there’s lots of humidity in the air. So someone recommended me dehumidifier. So I got this one. It’s really game changing product. Works very efficiently. Didn’t disturb while you sleeping, very silent. Full manual guide in there, as they said for continuous use there’s a direct drain. Little tank in the back of it which easily last full day and it depends on usage as well. Price is very reasonable as compared to market. Built quality is good too. Has wheels on it so you can move easily. Using it from last week i can feel the difference of air, it’s more fresh now. Try it you will feel the difference. Plenty of features in it like fan speed, levels how you prefer, it has inbuilt sensor which i like most will give you signal when its water tank full. Highly recommended"

What I like about this one is that it’s Small, it doesn’t take a lot of place, it’s almost noiseless, you can barely hear it and the fact that it stops automatically when it’s full ! Also, it comes with a hose to clean the water out of it. I also like the different mode on it, automatically and drying or ionizer fonction! Would definitely recommend."

This is bulky as expected, best to be put in middle area. Dehumidifier is much needed in certain months when humidity spikes causing other issues such as mold."

Nice and compact but powerful and quite. Highly recommend it.

This unit is wonderful. It is quiet for starters, and does not blow hot air out the side like some other models do.
The instructions are clear and concise and Operation is easy. The cord is long and allows for good placement of the unit just about anywhere. Continously or timed model allow for flexibility of different uses.
The only downfall is the drain tube could stand to be longer."

"Dehumidifier, 25 Pint Dehumidifier for Basement, Bedroom, Bathroom, Closet, with 3 Working Modes, 75 OZ Water Tank, Overflow Protection, and Auto Shut Off, Silent Dehumidifiers with Drain Hose","Ein Gebräu des Traumes - süffig, etwas süß, etwas herb",5.0,"Habe dieses Bier zum ersten Mal vor vielen Jahren bei einem Freund getrunken und es ging mir nie wirklich aus dem Kopf, nun habe ich über Amazon einen 24er Kasten bestellt. Lieferung von ""Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle"" sehr schnell, Montag Abend bestellt und Mittwoch Morgen geliefert - top! Die Flaschen kommen gut verpackt in einem Karton an.
Habe direkt zwei Flaschen kalt gestellt und eben meine erste geöffnet. Was soll ich sagen, das Gebräu schmeckt genau so, wie ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Geschmacklich würde ich sagen, es ist eine Mischung aus Vitamalz und Krombacher. So schmeckt es für mich persönlich. Es ist jedoch für meinen Geschmack nicht zu süß, auf keinen Fall so süß wie Vitamalz (was wirklich extrem süß ist). Den würzig herben Biergeschmack vom einem Krombacher schmeckt man deutlich raus, das macht es für mich zu einer perfekten Mischung.

Das Zeug ist jedenfalls extrem süffig, eine Flasche ist ruckzuck leer getrunken.

In Zukunft werde ich dieses Bier auf jeden Fall öfter vorrätig halten, gerade im Sommer mit Sicherheit eine perfekte Erfrischung.

Ich kann das Gebräu empfehlen, die Kaufabwicklung bei Amazon natürlich sowieso und den Anbieter selbst, ""Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle"". Hier stimmt alles!

Natürlich ist es eine Geschmacksache, ob man das Bier mag oder nicht. Wer sich unsicher ist : Magst du Vitamalz (oder vergleichbar)? Magst du normales Bier (Geschmacklich wie z.B. Krombacher - nicht so krass herb wie z.B. Jever)? Wenn du beides mit Ja beantwortest, dann wirst du dieses Bier mögen.

Ich bin kein Bier-Experte, dieses Rezension ist von einem Gelegenheits-Biertrinker.

Fünf Sterne. Prost!"
